Project Description:
This project is designed to simplify and speed up web browsing by creating a batch file that opens multiple web pages in a single execution. The batch script automates the process of launching different websites simultaneously, eliminating the need to open them manually one by one. Users can define the URLs they want to open, and with just a double-click, the script will open all the specified web pages in separate tabs of the default web browser.

Usefulness & How It Helps People:
Saves Time & Effort â€“ Instead of manually opening each website, users can access all necessary pages instantly with one click.

Enhances Productivity â€“ Ideal for professionals, students, and businesses who regularly visit multiple sites (e.g., work-related portals, email, research pages).

Customizable â€“ Users can modify the script to include specific websites based on their daily browsing needs.

Automation for Daily Workflows â€“ Useful for employees who need to open dashboards, news sites, and tools simultaneously when starting work.

Lightweight & Easy to Use â€“ No extra software required; works on any Windows system with minimal setup.
